# Fully Immersive Game Developer Experience Simulator

## Description
Develop the game in-game as you play! You choose what aspects of the game to develop next. Don't want to play in silence? Add music to the game! Getting bored of a text adventure? Develop some graphics! Soon your game will start to generate ad revenue. Then you can hire more developers.

This is a passion project I worked on during the summer of 2020. Unfortunately the project cannot progress until I find the time to make sprites and art.

## Installation
The game is accessible at [https://chardmuffin.github.io/FIGDES/](https://chardmuffin.github.io/FIGDES/) and should be playable from most browsers (not Internet Explorer). It should work on iOS 15+ on Safari and most Android devices.

### Windows
Alternatively, download the .exe file above if you are on Windows.

## Walkthrough
To progress through the game, you need to code new features (patches). It is always helpful to type "patches" to see the list of updates that can be coded.

Some patches require prior planning. Once the notepad has been scripted, you unlock the command for "plan"

Save Game capability is unlocked in game.
