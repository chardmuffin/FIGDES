# Fully Immersive Game Developer Experience Simulator
## Description
Develop the game in-game as you play! You choose what aspects of the game to develop next. Don't want to play in silence? Add music to the game! Getting bored of a text adventure? Develop some graphics! Soon your game will start to generate ad revenue. Then you can hire more developers.

This is a passion project I worked on during the summer of 2020. Unfortunately the project cannot progress further until I find the time to make sprites and art.

## Installation
The game is accessible at [https://chardmuffin.github.io/FIGDES/](https://chardmuffin.github.io/FIGDES/) and is playable on most browsers (not Internet Explorer). It does not currently work on mobile devices (unless your device has a physical keyboard).

### Windows
Alternatively, Windows users can download the FIGDES.exe and FIGDES.pck files above and place them in a dedicated directory. Run the .exe file to start.

## Walkthrough
To progress through the game, you need to code new features (patches). It is always helpful to type "patches" into the console to see the list of updates that can be coded.
Some patches require a prior planning phase. Developing the notepad patch unlocks the command for "plan."
Save Game capability is unlocked in game.
Further instructions are given in game.
