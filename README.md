# Fully Immersive Game Developer Experience Simulator 2022
## Description
Does your life lack recursion? Fully Immersive Game Developer Experience Simulator 2022 allows you to simulate being a game developer! As an indie developer, you are working on a game called Fully Immersive Game Developer Experience Simulator (FIGDES) which allows players to develop new features for their copy of the game as they play. Players choose which direction to take the game in. If the players don't want silence, they can program music into the game! Getting bored of a text adventure? Then they'll have to create graphics! etc. Your indie developer's game gains a cult following as strange coincidences start to happen...
 
 
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020. Unfortunately the project cannot progress further until I find the time to learn how to make game sprites and art.

## Installation
The game is accessible at [https://chardmuffin.github.io/FIGDES/](https://chardmuffin.github.io/FIGDES/) and is playable on most browsers (not Internet Explorer). It does not currently work on mobile devices (unless your device has a physical keyboard).

### Windows
Alternatively, Windows users can download the FIGDES.exe and FIGDES.pck files above and place them in a dedicated directory. Run the .exe file to start.

## Walkthrough
To progress through the game, you need to code new features (patches). It is always helpful to type "patches" into the console to see the list of updates that can be coded.
Some patches require a prior planning phase. Developing the notepad patch unlocks the command for "plan."
Save Game capability is unlocked in game.
Further instructions are given in game.
