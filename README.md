# Fully Immersive Game Developer Experience Simulator

## Description
Develop the game in-game! You choose what aspects of the game to develop next. Don't want to play in silence? Add music to the game! Getting bored of a text adventure? Develop some graphics! Soon your game will start to generate ad revenue. Then you can hire more developers.

This is a passion project I worked on during the summer of 2020. Unfortunately the project is on hold until I find the time to make sprites and art.
